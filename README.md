# Pathfinder-Algorithm
This is a pathfinding visualisation project implemented using python and the a\* search algorithm. This pathfinder project works to find the shortest pathway from one point to another and visualises the steps the algorithm takes so the user can see how its working.


## Local Setup
The only requirement for this project to run is for pygame to be installed which can be done if you follow the instructions below.

Install Pygame using CMD
`pip install pygame`
or if you're on Mac
`pip3 install pygame`


## How to run this project
1) Run the file astar.py

2) Select two points on the grid

3) Create obstacles for the algorithm to work around by clicking and drawing random points between the two points selected earlier.

4) Press spacebar to initiate the algorithm to find the shortest pathway between your selected points.
